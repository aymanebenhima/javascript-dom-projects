### Project Name: **Form Validation with SweetAlert Popup**

#### Objective

In this project, you'll build a dynamic form validation system using JavaScript. The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing real-time validation feedback and displaying a success message using SweetAlert when the form is correctly filled out.

#### Instructions

1. **HTML**: Review the structure in `index.html` to understand the form elements and their attributes.
2. **CSS**: Use `style.css` to style your form. Feel free to customize it to fit your design preferences.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Open the `script.js` file.
   - Follow the comments to implement the necessary validation logic.
   - Ensure that all fields are validated, and provide feedback to users for both valid and invalid inputs.
   - When the form is valid, display a SweetAlert popup to notify the user of successful registration.

#### Features to Implement

- **Toggle Submit Button**: The submit button should only be enabled when all fields are valid.
- **Error Messages**: Display appropriate error messages when fields are not filled out correctly.
- **Success Indicators**: Show success borders on valid inputs.
- **Email Validation**: Implement a regex check for valid email formats.
- **Password Match**: Ensure that both password fields match.
- **Final Submission**: On valid form submission, show a SweetAlert popup with a success message.

#### Hints

- Use JavaScript event listeners to handle focus and blur events on form fields.
- Utilize DOM manipulation to update the class of form elements based on validation results.
- Test your validation thoroughly to ensure all edge cases are handled.
