### Project Name: **Calculator: Your Personal Math Assistant ➕➖✖️➗**

#### Objective

In this project, you'll build a fully functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculations, and handling floating-point numbers. The goal is to practice handling user inputs, updating the DOM to reflect calculations, and managing state within a simple web application.

#### Instructions

1. **HTML**: Review the structure in `index.html` to understand the layout of the calculator, including the display area and buttons.
2. **CSS**: Use `styles.css` to style your calculator. Customize the appearance of buttons and the display area, ensuring a clean and user-friendly design.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Open the `script.js` file.
   - Implement the logic to handle button clicks, perform calculations, and update the display.
   - Ensure that the calculator supports floating-point numbers, percentage calculations, and standard arithmetic operations.

#### Features to Implement

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Allow the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Floating-Point Calculations**: Support decimal inputs and calculations with the `.` button.
- **Percentage Calculations**: Implement a percentage function using the `%` button.
- **Clear Button**: Reset the calculator display and state with the `C` button.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the calculator is accessible and usable on various screen sizes.

#### Hints

- Use JavaScript event listeners to handle button clicks and update the calculator display.
- Implement functions to manage the state of the current and previous inputs, and the selected operator.
- Consider edge cases, such as dividing by zero or handling multiple decimal points in a single number.
- Make sure the calculator's layout is visually appealing and easy to use, with clear feedback for user interactions.
- Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers and percentages.
