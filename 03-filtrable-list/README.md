### Project Name: **Filterable List: Dynamic Search üîç**

#### Objective

In this project, you'll create a dynamic search functionality that allows users to filter a list of items in real-time. The aim is to enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback as users type in their search queries. The project will also highlight matching text within the results and display a message when no matches are found.

#### Instructions

1. **HTML**: Review the structure in `index.html` to understand the layout of the search input and list elements.
2. **CSS**: Use `style.css` to style your list and search input. Customize the highlight style for search matches and the appearance of hidden list items.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Open the `script.js` file.
   - Implement the logic to filter the list items based on user input.
   - Highlight the matching portion of the text within the list items.
   - Display a message when no items match the search query.

#### Features to Implement

- **Real-Time Filtering**: As the user types in the search input, the list should update immediately, showing only items that match the query.
- **Text Highlighting**: The part of the text that matches the search query should be highlighted for easy identification.
- **No Results Message**: If no items match the search term, display a message informing the user.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the search functionality works well on different screen sizes.

#### Hints

- Utilize JavaScript to listen for input events on the search field and filter the list accordingly.
- Use DOM manipulation to dynamically update the list items based on the search query.
- Be creative with the CSS to make the search experience visually appealing, especially when highlighting matches or showing the "no results" message.
- Test with various search queries to ensure that the highlighting and filtering work as expected.
