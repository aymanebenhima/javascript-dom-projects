### Project Name: **To-Do List with CRUD Functionality**

#### Objective

This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive To-Do List application. You will learn how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Additionally, you'll implement a feature that allows users to mark tasks as completed. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with JavaScriptâ€™s array methods, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

#### Instructions

1. **HTML**: Review the structure in `index.html` to understand the structure of your To-Do List.
2. **CSS**: Use `style.css` to style your To-Do List. Feel free to add your own flair to make it visually appealing
3. **JavaScript**:
    - Open the `script.js` file.
    - Implement CRUD operations for tasks, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
    - Follow the comments in `script.js` to guide you through the development process.

#### Features to Implement

- **Add Task**: Users should be able to add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Task**: Allow users to update the text of an existing task.
- **Delete Task**: Users should be able to remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed, with a visual indicator (e.g., strikethrough or color change).
- **Persist Data**: (Optional) Use localStorage to save the tasks, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

### Hints

- Use array methods like push, splice, and map to manage the tasks.
- Leverage event delegation to handle clicks on dynamically added tasks.
- Use classes or IDs to distinguish between tasks and control their state (e.g., completed, editing).

### Creative Ideas for Improvement

- **Task Priority**: Add a feature to set task priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Task Categories**: Categorize tasks under different headings (e.g., Work, - Personal, Shopping).
- **Due Dates**: Allow users to set due dates for tasks and highlight overdue tasks.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode toggle for the To-Do List.
- **Drag and Drop**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
